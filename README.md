# AI Product Management Portfolio

This repository contains my AI Product Management (AI PM) portfolio — a curated collection of projects, case studies, artifacts, and write-ups that demonstrate my skills in applying AI to product strategy, research, and delivery.

## What’s included

- Prototypes, demos, and links to interactive artifacts
- Roadmaps, prioritization notes, and product spec excerpts
- Metrics, evaluation frameworks, and lessons learned

1. Clone or initialize the repo locally.
2. Open the project folder and inspect individual case study folders and files.
